# 🧩 Sudoku Solver in Python

This project is a Python-based Sudoku solver designed to approach the classic 9x9 puzzle using algorithms and techniques that allow efficient solving. The solver can analyze an incomplete Sudoku grid and fill in the missing numbers, adhering to the game’s rules that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contain unique numbers from 1 to 9.

The project is designed to evolve over time, adding functionality, improving performance, and exploring various solving strategies. Initial implementations may involve simple backtracking, while future updates could incorporate constraint propagation or other advanced techniques to increase solving speed and accuracy.
